# 👋🏽 Hi!

💬 About Me

I'm a Marine Corps veteran and aspiring software engineer, transitioning into tech by combining the discipline and hands-on work ethic from my professional experience with a Computer Science degree.
I never bought into the fear or doubt surrounding a career in tech—I set a goal, committed to it, and ran toward it with focus and determination.
