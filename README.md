# ğŸ‘‹ Hi,

ğŸ’¬ About Me

I'm a Marine Corps veteran and aspiring software engineer, transitioning into tech by combining the discipline and hands-on work ethic from my professional experience with a Computer Science degree.
I never bought into the fear or doubt surrounding a career in techâ€”I set a goal, committed to it, and ran toward it with focus and determination.
Outside of coding, I'm into weightlifting, God of War: RagnarÃ¶k, and watching MMA and Muay Thai bouts. I'm also a war movie enthusiast and the kind of guy who keeps a bugout bag readyâ€”just in case.
I bring that same intensity, strategy, and mindset of preparedness into every project I buildâ€”driven by purpose, precision, perseverance, and a genuine enthusiasm for learning and building.
